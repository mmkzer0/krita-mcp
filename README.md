# Krita MCP

An MCP server that lets Claude drive [Krita](https://krita.org): create
documents, build layer stacks, paint shapes and text, run filters, export
files — and *look at the canvas it just made*.

The banner above was painted by Claude through this bridge. So was
[the example poster](docs/example-poster.png). No hand-editing, no image
libraries — just tool calls.

## Why it's useful

Claude can't see what it's doing in most creative tools. Here it can:
`get_image` renders the canvas and hands back a PNG, so Claude draws, looks at
the result, notices the gradient banded or the reflection looks like a
staircase, and fixes it. That loop is the whole point.

It works on real Krita documents — your layers, your colour profiles, your
`.kra` files — not a sandbox.

## Requirements

- **Krita 5.2+** (developed and tested against 5.3.3)
- **Python 3.8+** on your PATH, for the MCP server
- An MCP client — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or anything else that speaks MCP

The MCP server uses **only the Python standard library**. There is nothing to
`pip install` and no virtualenv to manage.

## Install

### 1. Install the Krita plugin

Close Krita first — it rewrites its config on exit and would undo the enable
flag.

**Windows**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script copies the plugin into Krita's `pykrita` folder and sets
`enable_krita_mcp=true` in `kritarc`.

Prefer to do it by hand? Copy `pykrita/krita_mcp/` and
`pykrita/krita_mcp.desktop` into Krita's resource folder under `pykrita/`, then
enable **MCP Bridge** in *Settings → Configure Krita → Python Plugin Manager*.

### 2. Start Krita and check it

```bash
python mcp_server.py --selftest
```

```
health: Krita 5.3.3, plugin 1.0.0, 31 operations
  [ok] krita_instance         5.3.3
  [ok] create_document        64x48
  [ok] pixel_channel_order    read back r=255 g=0 b=0 on a little-endian host
  [ok] pixel_roundtrip        read #0080ff
  [ok] draw                   pixel at 10,10 is #ff0000
  ...
9/9 checks passed
```

Inside Krita, *Tools → Scripts* now has **Start/Stop MCP Bridge** and
**MCP Bridge Status…**.

### 3. Connect your MCP client

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add krita -- python /absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`
(`%APPDATA%\Claude\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` on
macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "krita": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client. Krita must be running for the tools to do anything.

## Try it

> Make a 1200×800 poster in Krita: a sunset over mountains reflected in water,
> on separate layers. Show me the result when you're done.

> Open `photo.jpg`, add a 40% opacity black layer, and put the title
> "SUMMER 1998" in the bottom left. Export it as `poster.png`.

> What layers are in my open document? Set the top one to multiply at 60%.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | Krita version and every open document |
| `inspect_document` | Canvas, colour space, full layer tree, selection |
| `create_document` / `open_document` | Make or load a document |
| `save_document` / `export_document` | Save in place or save-as; export to PNG/JPEG/etc. |
| `close_document` | Close a document (see *Known issue*) |
| `transform_image` | resize canvas, scale, rotate, crop, flatten |
| `create_layer` / `set_layer` / `delete_layer` | Layer stack management |
| `duplicate_layer` / `move_layer` / `merge_layer_down` | Restacking and merging |
| `get_image` | Render the canvas and return a PNG Claude can see |
| `get_pixel` | Exact colour at one pixel |
| `draw` | Shapes, text, gradients, bitmaps onto a paint layer |
| `apply_filter` | Any Krita filter, whole layer or a region |
| `set_selection` | rect / all / none / invert / grow / shrink / feather |
| `list_capabilities` | Filter names and parameters, blending mode ids |
| `trigger_action` | Fire a Krita menu action by id (`edit_undo`, …); script-running actions are refused while `run_python` is off (see *Arbitrary Python is opt-in*) |
| `run_python` | Arbitrary Python inside Krita, full libkis access — **off by default** |
| `self_test` | End-to-end health check |

### Arbitrary Python is opt-in

`run_python` executes whatever it is handed, with libkis and the whole standard
library in reach — the same trust level as handing over a shell. It is off in
two independent places, and both have to be on:

| Where | Switch | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP server | `python mcp_server.py --enable-exec` | off — the tool is not advertised and calls are refused before anything reaches Krita |
| Krita plugin | `allow_python=true` under `[krita_mcp]` in `kritarc`, or start Krita with `KRITA_MCP_ALLOW_PYTHON=1` | off — the bridge refuses the operation |

```bash
# both halves for one session
KRITA_MCP_ALLOW_PYTHON=1 krita &
claude mcp add krita -- python /absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py --enable-exec
```

An explicit "off" in either place wins: `allow_python=false` in `kritarc` cannot
be overridden by an environment variable left over in a shell profile, and
`KRITA_MCP_ALLOW_PYTHON=0` still forces one session off. Enabling takes an
explicit "on" in one of the two. `/health` leaves the operation out of the list
it reports while it is off, and *Tools → Scripts → MCP Bridge Status…* names the
state and which switch decided it (`enabled (environment)`, `enabled (kritarc)`,
or `disabled`).

While the gate is closed, `trigger_action` additionally refuses the action ids
that run scripts on a stock Krita (`execute_script_1..10`, `ten_scripts`,
`python_scripter`) — without that they are a way around the switch. Treat that
list as a guard, not a sandbox: a plugin you install can register its own
script runner and the bridge cannot see it.

**Which half does what.** `--enable-exec` governs the model-facing surface: the
tool is not advertised without it, and a call is refused before any request
leaves the MCP server. The plugin setting is the enforcement point: the bridge
refuses the operation itself, so it also covers `mcp_server.py --call` and
anything else that speaks HTTP to the loopback port with the token. Neither
switch is a sandbox.

What the gate is *not*: it does not contain a process that can already read
`krita_mcp_bridge.json`, and it does not restrict file paths — `open_document`,
`save_document` and `export_document` still reach anything you can. Connect only
clients you would let act as you inside Krita.

### Drawing

`draw` takes a list of commands rendered in order onto an RGBA/8-bit paint
layer: `fill_rect`, `rect` (optional corner radius), `ellipse`, `circle`,
`line`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `text`, `linear_gradient`, `radial_gradient`,
`image` (paste a base64 PNG), and `clear` (erase to transparency). Colours
accept `#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`, SVG names, or `[r,g,b,a]`.

Geometry uses `w`/`h`; outline thickness is `stroke_width`, kept separate so
the two can't be confused. Only the union of affected pixels is read, painted
and written back, so a small shape on a huge canvas stays cheap.

### Addressing layers

Layers are reported in docker order, top first. Reference one by name
(`"Sky"`), path through groups (`"Background/Sky"`), index path (`"#0/#1"`), or
`"uuid:…"`. Omit it for the active layer. Listings return all of these, so
there's always an unambiguous way to name a layer.

## How it works

```
MCP client  ──stdio JSON-RPC──▶  mcp_server.py  ──HTTP──▶  Krita plugin  ──▶  libkis
                                  (stdlib only)   loopback   (GUI thread)
```

Krita only runs Python *inside* itself, and MCP servers are separate processes,
so there are two halves. They find each other through a small file in Krita's
data folder holding the port and a random per-session token. The bridge binds
loopback only and requires that token, so a web page can't drive your Krita.

**The GUI-thread rule.** libkis isn't thread-safe. The HTTP server answers on
worker threads, so every Krita call is marshalled to Krita's GUI thread through
a queued Qt signal and waited on with a deadline. If Krita's UI is blocked — a
modal dialog, a long filter — you get a clean `krita_busy` error at the
deadline instead of a hung tool call. **Requests never hang.**

## Things worth knowing

**Drawing bypasses undo.** `draw` writes pixels directly, which Krita's undo
history doesn't record. Draw onto a layer you can delete. `apply_filter` on a
whole layer *is* undoable; on a sub-region it isn't, and the response says
which you got.

**Blending modes can't be validated.** Krita 5.3 has no API to enumerate
composite ops and accepts any string, silently rendering unknown ids as Normal.
`set_layer` canonicalises the ids it knows and warns on anything else, so a typo
is visible rather than silent.

**Direct pixel access needs RGBA/8-bit.** `draw`, `get_pixel` and per-layer
`get_image` refuse other colour spaces with a clear message. The merged
`get_image` works regardless.

## Known issue: closing documents can crash Krita

`close_document` occasionally takes Krita down — roughly one close in five at
the end of a long editing session. A freshly created or lightly edited document
closes reliably.

The fault is inside Krita's own C++ teardown, after `Document.close()` has
returned. It reproduces identically through Krita's own *File → Close*, so it
isn't caused by using libkis and isn't something a plugin can prevent. Tried and
ruled out: draining the image scheduler, disabling autosave, clearing the
modified flag, forcing a GC, pumping the event loop, closing views first, and
saving before closing — that last one is the intuitive fix and it doesn't help.

**Prefer leaving documents open and closing them yourself in Krita.** The tool
description tells Claude the same. If Krita does die, nothing hangs: the next
call returns a clear "could not reach Krita" message.

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not reach the Krita MCP bridge"** — Krita isn't running, or the plugin
isn't enabled. Check *Tools → Scripts → MCP Bridge Status…*. If the menu entries
are missing, the plugin didn't load: enable it in the Python Plugin Manager and
restart Krita.

**Tools don't appear in the client** — restart it after editing the config, and
make sure the path to `mcp_server.py` is absolute.

**Port already in use** — the bridge scans upward from 9797 and writes whichever
port it got into the discovery file, so this normally resolves itself. Set a
different starting port with `port=` under `[krita_mcp]` in `kritarc`.

**"run_python is disabled"** — that is the default (see *Arbitrary Python is
opt-in*). A model seeing this wants both switches: `--enable-exec` on the MCP
server and `allow_python=true` in `kritarc` (or `KRITA_MCP_ALLOW_PYTHON=1`
before Krita starts).

**Something crashed and you want to know why** — set `KRITA_MCP_TRACE=1` before
starting Krita to log every operation to `krita_mcp_trace.log` in Krita's data
folder, flushed per line. Krita is a GUI process with no console, so a trace
entry with no matching completion names the operation that killed it.

## Testing

```bash
python mcp_server.py --selftest    # quick health check inside Krita
python test_mcp.py                 # full suite, 77 checks
python test_mcp.py -v              # ...printing every tool result
python example_poster.py           # paint the example poster
python example_banner.py           # paint this README's banner
```

`test_mcp.py` spawns `mcp_server.py` and speaks real JSON-RPC to it, so a pass
covers the whole chain: protocol handshake, tool schemas, every tool against a
live Krita, pixel-exact drawing results, and the error paths. It cleans up after
itself.

Diagnostics:

```bash
python mcp_server.py --list-tools
python mcp_server.py --call status
python mcp_server.py --call draw --params-file commands.json
```

## Development

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File dev_reload.ps1
```

Copies the plugin sources over and hot-reloads `krita_mcp.ops` inside the
running Krita, so operations can be edited without restarting it. Changes to
`extension.py`, `httpserver.py` or `mainthread.py` still need a restart — those
objects already exist.

### Layout

```
mcp_server.py              MCP server (stdlib only) + CLI
install.ps1 / install.sh   install and enable the plugin
dev_reload.ps1             hot-reload during development

stress_close.py            soak test for the close path
example_poster.py          worked example, and the client the examples share
example_banner.py          paints this README's banner
pykrita/
  krita_mcp.desktop        plugin manifest
  krita_mcp/
    __init__.py            registers the extension
    extension.py           lifetime, menu actions, settings
    httpserver.py          loopback HTTP, auth, discovery file, tracing
    mainthread.py          worker thread -> GUI thread hand-off
    ops.py                 the operations
    imaging.py             QImage <-> Krita pixels, colour parsing
```

### Configuration

Krita reads these from `kritarc` under `[krita_mcp]`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autostart` | `true` | Start the bridge when Krita starts |
| `port` | `9797` | First port to try; scans upward if taken |

Environment variables, read by both halves:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `KRITA_MCP_STATE_DIR` | Override where the discovery file lives |
| `KRITA_MCP_TRACE` | Set to `1` before starting Krita to log every operation |
| `KRITA_MCP_PORT` / `KRITA_MCP_TOKEN` | Skip discovery and connect directly |

## Platform support

Developed and tested on **Windows 10 with Krita 5.3.3**. The code paths for
Linux and macOS are implemented — resource folders, config locations, the
installer — but have not been run there. Reports welcome.
